# Ona_Communities_WaterPoint



Data Processing for Communities Villages Water Points Code Challenge

Consider a dataset providing information on the functionality of infrastructure resources, for each water point it includes the name of the village it is in and its functional state.

Implement a data processing module which takes a dataset URL as input and returns:
The number of water points that are functional,
The number of water points per community,
The rank for each community by the percentage of broken water points.

There should be a top level object or function calculate("http://..."), which returns a data structure with the above information, something like:

{
  number_functional: ...,
  number_water_points: {
    communityA: ...,
  },
  community_ranking: ...
}

But thatâ€™s just a suggestion and we can think of alternative, maybe better, data structures to use.

We will use a water point dataset that contains many columns, the relevant ones are:

communities_villages, water_functioning

The data is at the below URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onaio/ona-tech/master/data/water_points.json

Building The Project

The project compiles with JDK >= 1.5 and Maven >= 3.1.1 as the build tool and to also manage the project dependencies.

To run Maven build, execute the following from a console/command prompt with the project root directory as the top level directory:

mvn clean package

This will create a distributable and War file for the web application.

Deploy the dataprocessor war file located under target/dataprocessor.war to a web server (tomcat) 

Start tomcat

Load the URL http://localhost:[portnumber]/dataprocessor/ to any browser to test.

To run junit tests, execute; mvn clean test
